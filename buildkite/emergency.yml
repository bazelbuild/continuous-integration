# This file allows Bazel team member to handle emergencies by
# - Setting a warning message (and a link to a GitHub issue) that is displayed
#   for every CI build
# - Specifying a known good version of Bazel that will be used for
#   every pipeline and task that hasn't specified an explicit version in
#   the respective pipeline configuration.
#
# Example:
#
# ---
# message: "Bazel 0.20.0 is broken"
# issue_url: "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/123"
# last_good_bazel: "0.19.0"
#
#
# ATTENTION:
# Please do not clear or delete this file when an incident is over.
# Instead, simply replace all values with empty strings ("").
