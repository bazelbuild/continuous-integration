### Install base packages.
{
  apt-get -qqy update
  apt-get -qqy dist-upgrade
  apt-get -qqy install zfsutils-linux
}

### Increase file descriptor limits
{
cat >> /etc/security/limits.conf <<EOF
*                soft    nofile          100000

### Install the Buildkite Agent on production images.
{
  apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 \
      --recv-keys 32A37959C2FA5C3C99EFBC32A79206696452D198
  add-apt-repository -y "deb https://apt.buildkite.com/buildkite-agent stable main"
  apt-get -qqy update
  apt-get -qqy install buildkite-agent

  # Disable the Buildkite agent service, as the startup script has to mount /var/lib/buildkite-agent
  # first.
  systemctl disable buildkite-agent

  mkdir /etc/systemd/system/buildkite-agent.service.d
  cat > /etc/systemd/system/buildkite-agent.service.d/override.conf <<'EOF'
[Service]
Restart=always
PermissionsStartOnly=true
# Disable tasks accounting, because Bazel is prone to run into resource limits there.
# This fixes the "cgroup: fork rejected by pids controller" error that some CI jobs triggered.
TasksAccounting=no
EOF

  mkdir /etc/systemd/system/buildkite-agent@.service.d
  cat > /etc/systemd/system/buildkite-agent@.service.d/override.conf <<'EOF'

}

### Install Docker.
{
  apt-get -qqy install apt-transport-https ca-certificates

  curl -sSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
  add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

  apt-get -qqy update
  apt-get -qqy install docker-ce

  # Allow the buildkite-agent user access to Docker.
  usermod -aG docker buildkite-agent

  # Disable the Docker service and related stuff, as the startup script has to mount
  # /var/lib/docker first.
  systemctl disable containerd
  systemctl disable docker
}

### Clean up and trim the filesystem (potentially reduces the final image size).
{
  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  fstrim -v /
  sleep 3
}

poweroff
